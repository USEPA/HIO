# Model files for building Hybrid Input-Output models

Model specifications and associated datasets for building hybrid input-output models with environmental extension.
These models may have various constructions including integrated hybrid, mixed unit input-output, and waste input-output.
These models use USEEIO as the base input-output model and are implemented using [useeior](https://github.com/USEPA/useeior) R software.
