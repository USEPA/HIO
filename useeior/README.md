# Building Hybrid Input-Output models

Model specifications and associated datasets for building hybrid input-output models with environmental extensions are found herein.
These models may have various constructions including integrated hybrid, mixed unit input-output, and waste input-output.
These models use USEEIO as the base input-output model and are implemented using [useeior](https://github.com/USEPA/useeior) R software.

A quick model overview is provided in the [modelspecs](modelspecs/) folder where the model specification files are found.
There is also a [notebook](demo_HIO_models.md) demonstrating how to build, validate, inspect and calculate the models.
